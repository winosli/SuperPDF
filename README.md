You need to manipulate documents (merge / compress / change, etc ...)

Super fast execution time with the ability to affect thousands of documents super fast.

Piece of code integrating a module or function into your program is a very simple task, the code is well organized.

Getting Started

Python Developer: The code is well organized - in the MODULES folder you can find all the modules for each of the options above (1-7), use main.py to call those modules or just copy 1 of them to your own project, you can easily call them by ModuleClass().start(), check main.py for all examples.
